## Installation
In order to run this program you will need a code editor, either VS code or something similar. Once opening the main file open the terminal and input 'node index.js' This will start the app.

## Usage 
Once the app starts user will be given a series of prompts to fill out. The first will be for the manager. Once that has been completed a prompt will appear asking if user would like to add another employee, either a engineer or an intern. Once those prompts have been completed they will return to being asked if they would like to add again. This process loops until the user is finished inputting all of their employees. Once completed a fully functional and styled webpage will be completed showing the users data and employees added.
